CodilitySolutions

IntelliJ IDEA project for writing Codility Lessions solutions written in Java.

Dedicated to my faithful friend Sime and all hard developers blessed by JavaScript fay.

Gitignore is empty, so just fork project, open it in IntelliJ IDEA and write solutions.

Use Ctrl+Shift+T to generate and run simple JUnit tests.
