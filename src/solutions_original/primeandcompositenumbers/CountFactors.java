/*
	A positive integer D is a factor of a positive integer N if there exists an integer M such that N = D * M.
	For example, 6 is a factor of 24, because M = 4 satisfies the above condition (24 = 6 * 4).
	Write a function:
	class Solution { public int solution(int N); }
	that, given a positive integer N, returns the number of its factors.
	For example, given N = 24, the function should return 8, because 24 has 8 factors, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. There are no other factors of 24.
	Assume that:
	N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
	Complexity:
	expected worst-case time complexity is O(sqrt(N));
	expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).
